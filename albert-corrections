First of all, you have Josep's copy with annotations. You have your own
notes, and I gave you a list of typos to correct.

Here is a list of more substantial modifications:

Provide a list of acronyms. (provided)

Section 1.1: remove the reference to Balsa. (corrected)

Chapter 2: Add AGDA, give a brief example of what it looks like and explain
how it is used. (corrected, \ref{sec:Agda-background})

Chapter 3: some of the material should go into the introduction, and some
in the conclusion. The whole chapter is out of place where it is now. (moved the content into the corresponding chapters) 

Chapter 4, Figure 4.6: Compare the performance rather than the number of
literals. (todo: can't do)

Chapter 6: create a diagram similar to Figure 4.7, to show how the various
methods used in the thesis fit together and how they are applied. Identify
your own contributions. Such a diagram could also go into the introduction
if you wish. (todo: added a paragraph clarifying this)

Chapter 5: Explain how the material differs from process algebra. Justify
the use of CPOG. Explain the differences between CPOG, PG and TPG, using
examples. Explain the syntax and semantics of AGDA. (todo: added a paragraph)

Chapter 6: section 6.3 should be moved forward, to motivate the example.
The SAT part should be explained more thoroughly, and perhaps moved to
an earlier part of the thesis. In section 6.1, justify the choice of TPG.
(todo: section moved. choice of tpg clarified)

Section 5.2: explain the precedence rules. (todo: explained)

Remove the duplicate paragraphs identified by Josep. (done)
Modify your citations to include the author's name. (todo?)
page 36: label the vertical axis of the plots. (todo?)
page 43: replace the phrase "real-life circuit" (done)
page 45: explain that the table uses multiple instances to calculate the
          total. (todo?)
