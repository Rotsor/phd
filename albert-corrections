Provided, p. viii.

> how it is used. 

Added section 2.4, p. 19.

Moved the content into the corresponding chapters: Section 3.1, p. 25, Section 4.1, p. 48, Section 5.1, p. 79.

Not done for the lack of data.

added Figure 1.3

Added a paragraph on p.49 explaining the differences from process algebra.

> Chapter 6: section 6.3 should be moved forward, to motivate the example.

Added a note on p. 50 explaining operator precedence.

Removed.
