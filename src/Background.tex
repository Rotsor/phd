\label{chap:Background}
This chapter introduces a brief overview of the major techniques and models used throughout the thesis. In particular, handshake circuits -- a specification formalism for synthesis of self-timed hardware; Petri nets -- a graph-based notation for reasoning about concurrent behaviour; conditional partial order graphs (CPOG) -- a versatile notation for describing a family of partial orders.
