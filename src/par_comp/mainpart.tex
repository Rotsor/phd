\section{Improved parallel composition}\label{se-main}

The improved parallel composition algorithm extends the
conventional one by adding a pre-processing step, where some
places are removed from the components, as they are guaranteed
to be implicit in the result. To identify these places, one can
note that a place is required in the final composition only if
under some reachable marking it can be the place that
disables some transition in its postset.

For simplicity, consider the parallel composition
$C=C_1\parallel C_2$, whose components synchronise on a single
signal $s$ which is an output of $C_1$ and an input of $C_2$.
Let $(M_1,M_2)$ be a reachable marking of $C$, where $M_1$ and
$M_2$ are some reachable markings of $C_1$ and $C_2$,
respectively. Furthermore, suppose that $M_1$ enables, say,
$s^+$ in $C_1$, where $s$ is an output. Now, if $M_2$ does not
enable $s^+$ in $C_2$, where $s$ is an input, then there is
computation interference. Therefore, if the FCI assumption
holds, $M_2$ has to enable $s^+$ in $C_2$, \ie whenever $s^+$
is enabled in $C_1$, it is also enabled in $C_2$. In other
words, the firing of $s^+$ in $C$ is fully controlled by $C_1$,
and so \emph{the constraints on firing of $s$ that are present
in $C_2$ can be ignored}. This means that the places in the
preset of an $s^+$-labelled transition in $C_2$ will be
implicit in the composition (subject to some technical
conditions formulated below), and so can be removed before the
composition is performed.

The above is true for the simple case of STGs with injective
labelling and no dummies. However, the general picture is more
complicated. In case of non-injective labelling, there can be
multiple transitions corresponding to the same input signal
transition, and the FCI assumption only guarantees the
enabledness of one of them. Hence, some `memory' (in the form
of places) is required to trace which of these transitions has
to be fired, which prohibits the removal of places from their
presets. Furthermore, if the STG contains dummies, removing
places from their postsets introduces some undesirable effects
explained later. These considerations lead to the following
conditions of applicability of the proposed optimisation.

\begin{proposition}\label{pr-main}
Let $C\DEF\parallel_{i\in I}C_{i}$ be a composition of STGs
that satisfies the FCI property and yields an
output-determinate STG, and, for each $i\in I$, $C_{i}'$ be the
STG obtained from $C_{i}$ by deleting all places $p$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item each transition $t\in\post{p}$ is labelled with a
    signal, say $s$, and:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item\label{only-inputs-in-postset} $s$ is an input;
\item\label{exists-matching-output} there is an STG $C_j$ for which $s$ is an output;
\item\label{injective-labelling} there are at most one
    $s^+$- and at most one $s^-$-la\-bel\-led
    transition in $C_i$;
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{no-dummies-in-preset} $\pre{p}$ does not
    contain dummy transitions.
\end{enumerate}
Then $C'\DEF\parallel_{i\in I}C_i'$ and $C$ are bisimilar.
\end{proposition}

The proposition can be depicted schematically by a diagram in Fig.~\ref{fi-parcomp-improvement-theorem}.
Here the boxes named $S_1$ and $S_2$ represent the original STGs, 
$S_1'$ and $S_2'$ are represent STGs obtained from $S_1$ and $S_2$ by removing places according to
 the rules detailed above, and $S_1 \parallel S_2$ and $S_1' \parallel S_2'$ represent 
$S_1$ composed with $S_2$ and $S_1'$ composed with $S_2'$ respectively. 
We use a dashed line to signify the bisimulation relation between $S_1 \parallel S_2$ and $S_1' \parallel S_2'$.

 
The conditions~\ref{only-inputs-in-postset}
and~\ref{exists-matching-output} are intrinsic to the proposed
method, and essentially state that due to the FCI assumption,
firing of an input signal in a component can be controlled from
the outside (\viz by the component controlling the
corresponding output --- whose existence is ensured
by~\ref{exists-matching-output}), and so the component itself
can get rid of the places controlling it.

The conditions~\ref{injective-labelling}
and~\ref{no-dummies-in-preset} are technical restrictions on
application of our method. If
condition~\ref{injective-labelling} is violated, there are
several transitions that have the same label, say $s^+$ (where
$s$ is an input) in the component. When the corresponding
output $s^+$ is produced by some other component, only one of
these transitions should fire to match it --- but to know which
one, the component needs to control their firing, and so the
places in their presets cannot be removed.

The necessity of condition~\ref{no-dummies-in-preset} is
illustrated by Fig.~\ref{fi-dummy-counterexample}. Intuitively,
the original STG on the left either receives $a^+$ followed by
$b^+$ without outputting anything, or receives $b^+$ and
produces $x^+$ in response. However, if the places in front of
$a^+$ and $b^+$ are removed (which would be possible without
condition~\ref{no-dummies-in-preset}), as shown on the right,
then it might produce the unexpected $x^+$ after the trace
$a^+\,b^+$. Intuitively, in the initial STG firing of $a^+$
acts as an evidence that the dummy transition in the right
branch has fired, while in the modified one the postset of this
dummy transition has been removed, and so it is not possible
anymore to guarantee that it has fired when $a^+$ fires.

\section{Proof of Proposition \ref{pr-main}}

We begin with defining the witness $R$ for simulation of $C$ by $C'$.
We say that $(M,M') \in R$ iff $M$ is reachable in $C$ and 
for all places $p \in P'$, $M(p)=M'(p)$.
Note that since $C'$ can be obtained from $C$ by removing places, $P' \subseteq P$ so $M(p)$ is always defined.
Also note that for any given reachable marking $M$ there is exactly one $M'$ such that $(M,M') \in R$, obtained by 
restricting the domain of $M$, so $R$ is a function and we employ the notation $M' = R(M)$ to use it as such.

Now we need to prove that the introduced relation $R$ is indeed bisimulation. 
We'll start by proving that $C'$ simulates $C$ with $R$.
To prove that we first need to show $M'_N = R(M_N)$. That follows from both parallel composition and place removal preserving initial markings of individual places.
Now given a reachable marking $M^1$ with an enabled transition $M^1 \ifrs {l} M^2$ we must show that $R(M^1) \ifrs {l} R(M^2)$. To prove that we note that any transition enabled in $M^1$ must also be enabled in $R(M^1)$ because the enabledness condition gets weakened with removal of places. Using that fact we show that whichever transition $t$ labelled $l$ was enabled to allow $M^1 \tfrs t M^2$ it is also enabled in $R(M^1)$. The marking after firing must coincide with $R(M^2)$ because the arcs to existing places and their weights are preserved by place removal. This shows $R(M^1) \ifrs {l} R(M^2)$ and concludes the proof that $C'$ simulates $C$.

In the second part of the proof we show that $C$ simulates $C'$. Here, given $R(M^1) \ifrs {l} M'^2$ we need to show that there exists a $M^2$ such that $M^1 \ifrs {l} M^2$ and $M'^2 = R(M^2)$. Again, we note that there must be a transition $t'$ labelled $l$ such that $R(M^1) \tfrs t' M'^2$. If the corresponding transition $t$ is enabled $M^1 \tfrs t M^2$ then the proof is complete since we already showed that $M'^2$ must be equal to $R(M^2)$. For the sake of contradiction suppose $t$ is not enabled in marking $M^1$. Then there is necessarily one of the deleted places $p$ in $\pre{t}$ in some of the component STGs $C_i$, and the number of tokens in this place at marking $M^1$ is
smaller than the weight of the arc $(p,t)$ in $C_i$ (*)
Since by condition~\ref{only-inputs-in-postset} $\post{p}$ can
contain only input transitions, $t$ must be labelled by
$s^\pm$, where $s$ is an input signal of $C_i$; \wlogg, we
assume that the label is $s^+$. By
condition~\ref{exists-matching-output} there is also a
component STG $C_j$ where $s$ is an output signal.

Let $\sigma$ be an execution of $C$ terminating at marking $M^1$,
and $\nu$ be the trace corresponding to $\sigma$ (note that
such a $\sigma$ always exists as we restrict $R$ to only include reachable markings).
We proceed by showing that (i)
$\nu|_{C_j}s^+$ is a trace of $C_j$ and (ii) $\nu\, s^+$ is not
a trace of $C$; these would mean that there is a violation of
FCI in the original composition, leading to a contradiction.

(i) Since $s^+$-labelled transition $t'$ is enabled in marking $R(M^1)$ of $C'$, 
its component $t_j$ must be also be enabled in $C_j'$ and labelled by the same signal $s^+$.
Since $s$ is an output in $C_j$, no places were removed from $\pre{t_j}$ when building
$C_j'$ due to condition~\ref{only-inputs-in-postset}, which
means that $t_j$ is also enabled by the marking $M^1_j$, and so $\nu|_{C_j}s^+$
is a trace of $C_j$.

(ii) For the sake of contradiction, suppose $\nu\,s^+$ is a
trace of $C$. Due to the output-determinacy of $C$, the set of
outputs by which $\nu$ can be extended is uniquely determined,
and so $s^+$ must be enabled by $M^1$ (perhaps, after firing
several dummy transitions). By
condition~\ref{injective-labelling} there is only one
$s^+$-labelled transition in $C_i$ (\viz $t$), and so each
$s^+$-labelled transition in $C$ has $p$ in its preset with the
arc from $p$ to this transition having the same weight as the
arc $(p,t)$ in $C_i$. Consequently, each $s^+$-transition in
$C$ is blocked at marking $M^1$ because by (*) the number of tokens
in $p$ is smaller than the weight of the corresponding arc.
Moreover, firing only dummy transitions cannot increase the
number of tokens in $p$ and thus enable an $s^+$-labelled
transition, as by condition~\ref{no-dummies-in-preset}
$\pre{p}$ contains no dummy transitions, a contradiction. Hence
$\nu\,s^+$ is not a trace of $C$.

As explained above, (i) and (ii) imply a violation of FCI and
so lead to a contradiction, which means that $C$ and
$C'$ must be bisimilar.

\section{Discussion}

In practice, when performing the parallel composition, one
would like as few implicit places as possible in the result,
and so it would be desirable to weaken the conditions in
Prop.~\ref{pr-main}, so that as many places as possible are
removed. As the conditions~\ref{only-inputs-in-postset}
and~\ref{exists-matching-output} are intrinsic, it is unlikely
that they can be relaxed. However, the technical
conditions~\ref{injective-labelling}
and~\ref{no-dummies-in-preset} can be dealt with --- by
ensuring that the components always satisfy them. Indeed, as
mentioned in Sect.~\ref{sec_pn_basic}, for output-determinate
STGs the language is the semantics, and so one often can remove
dummy transitions and enforce injective labelling without
changing the language, \eg using the \petrify
tool~\cite{ckkly97}; this will ensure that
conditions~\ref{injective-labelling}
and~\ref{no-dummies-in-preset} hold. An example of such a
transformation for the \balsa standard component Call is shown
in Fig.~\ref{fi-enforce-inj}. This operation is performed on
(small) components rather than the (large) composition, and so
is usually cheap. Moreover, in some applications, in particular
circuit re-synthesis, the components are taken from a fixed
library of component types, and so the transformation can be
performed only once for each component type, and subsequently
incur no runtime penalty at all.
