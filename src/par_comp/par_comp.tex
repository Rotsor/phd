\chapter{Improved Parallel Composition}

\label{chap:ParComp}

The contents of this chapter is based on the results published previously in \cite{improved_par_comp}. The chapter covers in detail the proposed modification to the labelled Petri nets parallel composition algorithm allowing for simpler resulting nets while preserving result equivalence up to bisimulation.

\section{Summary}

We have presented an improved algorithm for computing the
parallel composition of STGs or labelled Petri nets. Under the
FCI assumptions, it allows to produce nets with fewer implicit
places, which aids the subsequent structural algorithms like
dummy contraction. It uses only simple structural checks and
thus is very efficient even for large compositions, so the
improvement comes at negligible cost.

The algorithm was implemented in the \pcomp tool and evaluated
on a set of scalable benchmarks. The experiments proved its
efficiency, which increases even more when the components are
pre-processed to remove dummies and ensure injective labelling
(this is usually cheap, as the components are small; moreover,
if the components come from a standard library of component
types, this step can be completely eliminated).

Another important advantage is that the improved algorithm
places almost no additional effort on the user: the only
requirement is to pass an additional command-line option to
\pcomp so that it can assume the FCI property and apply the
proposed optimisation.
