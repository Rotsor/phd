\chapter{Improved Parallel Composition of Labelled Petri Nets}

\label{chap:ParComp}

The contents of this chapter is based on the results published previously in \cite{improved_par_comp}. The chapter covers in detail the proposed modification to the labelled Petri nets parallel composition algorithm allowing for simpler resulting nets while preserving result equivalence up to bisimulation.
