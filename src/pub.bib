  title = {An Introduction to Asynchronous Circuit Design},
  institution = utah,
  year = {1997},
  abstract = {The purpose of this monograph is to provide both an introduction to
	field of asynchronous digital circuit design and an overview of
	the practical state of the art in 1997. In the early days of digital
	circuit design, little distinction was made between synchronous
	and asynchronous circuits. However, since the 1960's, the mainstream
	of the digital circuit design enterprise has been primarily concerned
	with synchronous circuits. Synchronous circuits may be simply defined
	as circuits which are sequenced by one or more globally distributed
	periodic timing signals called clocks. Asynchronous circuits are
	an inherently larger class of circuits, since there are may sequencing
	options other than global periodic clock signals. Asynchronous circuits
	have been studied in one form or another since the early 1950's
	[92] when the focus was primarily on mechanical relay circuits.
	A number of theoretical issues were studied in detail by Muller
	and Bartky as early as 1956 [138]. Since then, the field of asynchronous
	circuits has gone through a number of high-interest cycles. In recent
	years there has been an unprecedented level of interest in both
	academic and industrial settings [81]. Much of this recent research
	effort has focused more on theory than practice. Nonetheless, the
	advance of practical asynchronous circuit design techniques also
	has an unusual level of interest. The focus of this document is
