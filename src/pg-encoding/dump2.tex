This section demonstrates application of the CPOG-based methodology
to specification and synthesis of processor microcontrollers, and
discusses the results of optimal instruction encoding methods presented
in the previous section. Specification of such a complex system as
a processor starts at the architectural level which helps to deal
with the system complexity by structural abstraction~\cite{1994_de_micheli_book}.
Numerous processor architectures have emerged since fundamental von
Neumann architecture\emph{~}\cite{1946_burks_architecture} and Harvard
architecture\emph{~}\cite{1946_aiken_calculator} were proposed.
The example processor is built on the basis of Harvard architecture;
however, the method for optimal encoding of instructions presented
here is applicable to both architectures, including their
numerous derivatives.


\subsection{Architecture}

Figure~\ref{app-fig-Architecture-of-example} shows the architecture
of the example processor. Separate \emph{Program memory} and \emph{Data
memory} blocks are accessed via \emph{Instruction fetch} (IFU) and
\emph{Memory access} (MAU) operational units, respectively. The
other two operational units are: ALU and \emph{Program counter increment
unit} (PCIU). The units are controlled via request-acknowledgement
interfaces (depicted as bidirectional arrows) by \emph{Central microcontroller}
which is our primary specification and synthesis objective. 

There are four registers: general purpose registers $A$ and $B$,
\emph{Program counter} (PC) which stores address of the current
instruction in the program memory, and \emph{Instruction register}
(IR) which stores opcode of the current instruction. For the purpose
of this example the actual width of the registers (the number of bits
they can store) is not important. ALU has access to all the registers
via the register bus; MAU accesses only general purpose registers;
IFU reads opcode of the next instruction into IR given its address
in PC; PCIU is responsible for incrementing PC (moving to the next
instruction). The microcontroller has access to the opcode and ALU
\emph{flags} (information about the current state of ALU which is
used in branching instructions).


Now we have to define the set of instructions of the processor. Rather
than to list every single instruction it is easier to describe classes
of instructions with the same \emph{addressing mode}~\cite{mspmanual}
and partial order representation.

\textbf{ALU operation Rn to Rn}

An instruction from this class takes two operands stored in general
purpose registers $\{A,\ B\}$, performs an operation over them, and
writes the result back into one of them (so called \emph{register
direct addressing mode}). Examples: $\mathit{ADD\ A,\ B}$ -- addition
$A=A+B$; $\mathit{MOV\ B,\ A}$ -- assignment $B=A$. Figure~\ref{app-fig-Scenarios-of-8}(a)
shows the corresponding partial order of actions that have to be performed:
ALU works concurrently with PC increment (PCIU) and the next instruction
fetch (IFU) actions. As soon as both concurrent branches are completed,
the processor is ready to execute the next instruction. Note that
it is not important for the microcontroller which particular ALU operation
is being executed ($\mathit{ADD}$, $\mathit{MOV}$, or any other)
because the partial order of actions is not affected by this choice.
It is responsibility of ALU to detect which operation it has to perform
according to the current opcode. Therefore, it is sufficient to specify
only 8 behavioural scenarios of the microcontroller (as there are
8 classes of instructions).

\textbf{ALU operation \#123 to Rn}

In this set of instructions one of the operands is register and another
is a constant which is given immediately after the instruction opcode
(e.g. $\mathit{SUB\ A,\ \#1}$ -- decrement $A$ by one), hence the
name: \emph{immediate addressing mode}. Figure~\ref{app-fig-Scenarios-of-8}(b)
shows the partial order of actions for such an instruction. At first,
the constant has to be fetched into IR (events PCIU and IFU). Then
ALU is executed concurrently with another increment of PC. Finally,
it is possible to fetch the next instruction into IR.

\textbf{ALU operation Rn to PC}

This class contains operations for unconditional branching, in which
PC register is modified. Branching can be absolute or relative: $\mathit{MOV\ PC,\ A}$
-- absolute branch to address stored in register $A$; $\mathit{ADD\ PC,\ B}$
-- relative branch to the address $B$ instructions ahead of the current
address. The partial order is very simple in this case: ALU is followed
with IFU -- see Figure~\ref{app-fig-Scenarios-of-8}(c).

\textbf{ALU operation \#123 to PC}

Instructions in this class are similar to those above with the exception
that the branch address is specified explicitly as a constant. The
actions should be scheduled in the following sequence: PCIU$\rightarrow$IFU
(to fetch the constant) followed by ALU and finally another IFU, as
shown in Figure~\ref{app-fig-Scenarios-of-8}(d).

\textbf{Memory access}

There are two instructions in this class: $\mathit{LOAD\ A}$ and
$\mathit{SAVE\ A}$. They load/save register $A$ from/to memory location
with address stored in register $B$. Figure~\ref{app-fig-Scenarios-of-8}(e)
shows that access to memory can be performed concurrently with the
next instruction fetch, exploiting the advantage of Harvard architecture.

\textbf{Conditional operations Rn to Rn, \#123 to Rn/PC}

These three classes of instructions are similar to their unconditional
versions above with the difference that they are performed only if
the following condition is true: $A<B$, i.e. register $A$ contains
a value which is less than that in register $B$. The first ALU action
compares registers $A$ and $B$, and changes ALU flags $\{le,\ ge\}$
according to the comparison result. These flags are thereafter checked
by the microcontroller in order to decide on the further scheduling
of actions. Consider, for example, conditional partial order in Figure~\ref{app-fig-Scenarios-of-8}(h).
It starts with concurrent increment of PC and comparison of registers
$A$ and $B$. If condition $A<B$ holds (i.e. $le\cdot\overline{ge}=1$)
then the process continues with the following sequence of actions:
IFU$\rightarrow$ALU/2$\rightarrow$IFU/2 (read the constant, perform
the branch, fetch the next instruction). Otherwise, the constant is
skipped (PCIU/2) and the next instruction is fetched (IFU/2). See~\cite{2009_mokhov_phd}
for details on dynamic CPOGs, which allow some of the operational
variables to be evaluated during execution of one of the scenarios
(in our case such dynamic variables are $\{le,\ ge\}$).
