% productivity gap
One of the major challenges for the future of semiconductor industry is the problem of overcoming the design productivity gap. This gap is caused by the exponential complexity growth of electronic systems~\cite{Moore_1965_e}  while the capability of design tools cannot cope with this pace, see Fig.~\ref{fig:productivity_gap}. The only way to deal with the increasing complexity of Integrated Circuits (ICs) is to improve the efficiency of the design process, in particular, by heavily reusing system components and by advancing the design automation methods.

% design reuse and need for async design principles
It has been predicted by ITRS~\cite{ITRS_2011} that in order to address the productivity gap challenge, by 2020 at least 90\% of the complex circuits should be built of previously designed components. This rises the need for compositional (or modular) design principles where the timing of individual modules is independent of the rest of the system and  therefore requires delay insensitive communication between the modules. This communication discipline is natural for asynchronous circuits where the data transfer is accompanied by request-acknowledgement handshaking between the sending and the receiving counterparts. On this pathway the previously designed Intellectual Property (IP) cores will need to be adapted to the new modular architectures. The least intrusive is the Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) approach~\cite{Chapiro_1984_phd} where special wrappers~\cite{Mullins_2007_async, Fan_2009_iccd} are built around synchronous modules to convert their communication into asynchronous handshake style. Another alternative is desynchronisation techniques~\cite{Cortadella_2006_ieeetcad} where the global clock is replaced by a distributed control which determines when the computation is complete and the output result is ready to be consumed. This control may take different forms, from a delay line matching the critical path of the module~\cite{Cortadella_2010_icicdt} to explicitly introduced completion detection logic~\cite{Kondratyev_2002_ieeedtc}.

% synthesis of async components
The remaining 10\% of the IC components, as well as the interface and control logic to support the interconnect and communication flexibility, will still need to be designed from scratch. One way is to design those components in traditional synchronous way and then apply the previously discussed techniques to comply with the delay insensitive interface requirements. This, however, may result in suboptimal solutions in terms of circuit area, computation speed and energy consumption. Better results can be achieved if the components are designed and implemented with their asynchronous environment in mind~\cite{Martin_2006_ieeeproc}. However, the logic synthesis of asynchronous circuits is computationally expensive and not applicable to large modules. This is due to high level of concurrency in truly asynchronous systems which results in a state space explosion.  The computation complexity problem has been successfully addressed in the syntax-driven translation~\cite{balsa} approach which is based on direct mapping of a specification into hardware components without going through the state space exploration (it is assumed that there is one-to-one correspondence between the specification language constructs and the library of available components).

% need for compositional approach
The major drawback of the circuits obtained by the syntax-driven translation is the suboptimal performance of their control structures~\cite{Plana-balsa-control-overhead}. In order to resolve this issue the control models of all the components need to be composed together and resynthesised exploiting the benefits of their joint optimisation. Existing resynthesis methods are based on parallel composition of component models expressed in form of Petri nets~\cite{carmona-handshake-clustering}. However, the efficient parallel composition of the component models is still an open question and is one of the primary goals of this thesis.

% structural and behavioural aspects of composition
The composition of circuit components is of structural nature - they are combined via input-output interfaces according to the casual dependency between the operation they perform, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:composition_structural}.
Another compositional aspect is a combination of several mutually exclusive behaviours in the same circuit. A naive way to build such a circuit is to implement the different behaviour scenarious in separate modules and structurally compose them with the use of multiplexers and demultiplexers, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:composition_behavioural_naive}. A mode selection code on the (de)multiplexors determines the current scenario.  While this is a valid implementation of multi-modal functionality, it ignores the mutually exclusive feature of the implemented behaviours and ignores a possibility of partial hardware reuse for common functionality, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:composition_behavioural}.

A model which naturally captures the structural and behavioural aspects of composition in a single formalism is Conditional Partial Order Graphs (CPOGs)~\cite{2009_mokhov_phd}. This graph-based model is capable of expressing the structural composition by means of causality arcs (similar to Petri nets) and the behavioural composition by means of Boolean "visibility" conditions on its vertices. While CPOGs is a convenient tool for reasoning on small benchmarks, it lacks the means for capturing and transformation of large systems. The first  goal of this thesis is to generalise the CPOGs model and transition from the acyclic graphs representing partial orders into a universal Parameterised Graphs (PGs). The second goal is to introduce a theory for PG manipulation in algebraic form, which enables equivalence-preserving manipulation of graphs in symbolic form and simplifies specification and reasoning about complex systems.

The Boolean conditions on graph vertices can be expressed in various forms targeting different optimisation criteria. In the context of digital circuit design these conditions are subsequently implemented as the hardware control logic, therefore such optimisation targets as minimising the number of control variables and/or reducing the complexity of logical expressions, is of paramount importance. The ambitious goal of this thesis is to solve the optimisation problem for the general case, to express it in terms of Boolean satisfiability problem and to employ the existing SAT solving tools for obtaining the best result.
