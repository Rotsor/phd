\chapter{Introduction}

We explore the available formalisms for design of asynchronous digital
circuits and compare them with the principle of compositionality in
mind. We propose improvements to the existing techniques and
propose a new formalism, Parametrised Graph (PG) Algebra, which is a
generalisation of the existing CPOG formalism. The We furhter study 
the theory of PG Algebra and present mechanised formal proofs of certain properties.

\section{Motivation}

With constantly growing transistor counts and consumer demands, the complexity of digital circuits must grow too.

With the rising complexity of digital circuits, it becomes increasingly important to reuse parts of existing designs.

The reuse of the components must be facilitated by the design language.

\subsection{Compositionality}

The key property facilitating component reuse is compositionality.

Compositionality is a property of a given language where the meaning of a language construct is determined by the meanings of its parts.
