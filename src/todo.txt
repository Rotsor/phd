Dear all,

Attached is the current version of my thesis draft. There is still a lot to do to make it of acceptable quality and I'm afraid I won't be able to do it without your help!

The things I will be able to do by myself:
* Tidy up the pictures and formatting
* Complete the Appendix by adding the relevant source code
* Fix the wrong theorem in Chapter 4

The things I need help with:

* Introduction:

Sections 1.4-1.7 do not fit into introduction well at all. They are just introductions copied from the corresponding papers. We need to move the text somewhere or recombine into a sensible structure. Section 1.1. Motivation is also basically non-existant and needs to be expanded.

* Conclusion:

Current conclusion, as well as introduction, is just a collection of conclusions from various papers.

* Chapters 6:

I think there is some content intersections with Andrey's thesis and a little bit with Chapter 5.
I will probably need to remove something, but I will need Andrey's help to do that.

Have a good day,
Arseniy
