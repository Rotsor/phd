\section*{Intependent contributions}


Chapters 5 and 6 contain material found in collaborative publications \cite{cpog_encoding,pg_algebra}.

My independent contribution is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Section 5.5. Formalisation of PG Theory.
\item
I have also contributed to other parts of PG Theory as presented in Sections 5.1-5.4.
\item
After stating the problem of processor instruction set encoding together with my supervisors,
all the formalisation of Chapter 6 and the SAT solver integration was performed by me.
\end{itemize}
