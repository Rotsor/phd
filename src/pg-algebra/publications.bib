  title = {An Introduction to Asynchronous Circuit Design},
  institution = utah,
  year = {1997},
  abstract = {The purpose of this monograph is to provide both an introduction to
	field of asynchronous digital circuit design and an overview of
	the practical state of the art in 1997. In the early days of digital
	circuit design, little distinction was made between synchronous
	and asynchronous circuits. However, since the 1960's, the mainstream
	of the digital circuit design enterprise has been primarily concerned
	with synchronous circuits. Synchronous circuits may be simply defined
	as circuits which are sequenced by one or more globally distributed
	periodic timing signals called clocks. Asynchronous circuits are
	an inherently larger class of circuits, since there are may sequencing
	options other than global periodic clock signals. Asynchronous circuits
	have been studied in one form or another since the early 1950's
	[92] when the focus was primarily on mechanical relay circuits.
	A number of theoretical issues were studied in detail by Muller
	and Bartky as early as 1956 [138]. Since then, the field of asynchronous
	circuits has gone through a number of high-interest cycles. In recent
	years there has been an unprecedented level of interest in both
	academic and industrial settings [81]. Much of this recent research
	effort has focused more on theory than practice. Nonetheless, the
	advance of practical asynchronous circuit design techniques also
	has an unusual level of interest. The focus of this document is
	on the aspects of the asynchronous circuit design discipline which
	are either likely, or have been an in uence on the practical design
	of asynchronous circuits. The attempt is to provide an introduction
	to the basic concepts which provide the foundation for today's design
	techniques and to summarize the current practice. The text contains
	an extensive set of bibliographical pointers to guide the more serious
	student of the field.},

  abstract = {Dual-rail encoding, return-to-spacer protocol, and hazard-free logic

	logic uses a protocol with a single spacer, e.g., all-zeros, which
	gives rise to energy balancing problems. We address these problems
	by incorporating two spacers; the spacers alternate between adjacent
	clock cycles. This guarantees that all gates switch in every clock
	cycle regardless of the transmitted data values. To generate these
	dual-rail circuits, an automated tool has been developed. It is
	capable of converting synchronous netlists into dual-rail circuits
	and it is interfaced to industry CAD tools. Dual-rail and single-rail

	timing. Timing can be directly added, removed, and optimized using
	this style. RT synthesis and verification are demonstrated on three
	example circuits, facilitating transformations from speed-independent
	circuits to burst-mode and pulse-mode circuits. Relative timing
	enables improved performance, area, power, and functional testability
	of up to a factor of 3 in all three cases. This method is the foundation
	of optimized timed circuit designs used in an industrial test chip,
	and may be formalized and automated.},

  abstract = {Block based statistical timing analysis (STA) tools often yield less
	accurate results when timing variables become correlated due to
	global source of variations and path reconvergence. To the best
	of our knowledge, no good solution is available handling both types
	of correlations simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel
	statistical timing algorithm, AMECT (Asymptotic MAX/MIN approximation
	& Extended Canonical Timing model), that produces accurate timing
	estimation by handling both types of correlations simultaneously.
	An extended canonical timing model is developed to evaluate and
	decompose correlations between arbitrary timing variables. And an
	intelligent pruning method is designed enabling trade-off runtime
	with accuracy. Tested with ISCAS benchmark suites, AMECT shows both
	high accuracy and high performance compared with Monte Carlo simulation
	results: with distribution estimation error < 1.5% while with around
	350X speed up on a circuit with 5355 gates.},
