\section{Improved parallel composition}

We have presented an improved algorithm for computing the
parallel composition of STGs or labelled Petri nets. Under the
FCI assumptions, it allows to produce nets with fewer implicit
places, which aids the subsequent structural algorithms like
dummy contraction. It uses only simple structural checks and
thus is very efficient even for large compositions, so the
improvement comes at negligible cost.

The algorithm was implemented in the \pcomp tool and evaluated
on a set of scalable benchmarks. The experiments proved its
efficiency, which increases even more when the components are
pre-processed to remove dummies and ensure injective labelling
(this is usually cheap, as the components are small; moreover,
if the components come from a standard library of component
types, this step can be completely eliminated).

Another important advantage is that the improved algorithm
places almost no additional effort on the user: the only
requirement is to pass an additional command-line option to
\pcomp so that it can assume the FCI property and apply the
proposed optimisation.

\section{PG theory}

We introduced a new formalism called Parametrised Graphs and the
corresponding algebra. The formalism allows to manage a large number
of system configurations and execution modes, exploit similarities
between them to simplify the specification, and to work with groups
of configurations and modes rather than with individual ones. The
modes and groups of modes can be managed in a compositional way, and
the specifications can be manipulated (transformed and/or optimised)
algebraically in a fully formal and natural way.

We develop two variants of the algebra of parametrised graphs, corresponding
to the two natural graph equivalences: graph isomorphism and isomorphism
of transitive closures. Both cases are specified axiomatically, and
the soundness, minimality and completeness of the resulting sets of
axioms are formally proved. Moreover, the canonical forms of algebraic
terms are developed in each case.

The usefulness of the developed formalism has been demonstrated on
two case studies, a phase encoding controller and a processor micro-controller.
Both have a large number of execution scenarios, and the developed
formalism allows to capture them algebraically, by composing individual
scenarios and groups of scenarios. The possibility of algebraical
manipulation was essential to obtain the optimised final specification
in each case.

The developed formalism is also convenient for implementation in a
tool, as manipulating algebraic terms is much easier than general
graph manipulation; in particular, the theory of term rewriting can
be naturally applied to derive the canonical forms.

In future work we plan to automate the algebraic manipulation of PGs,
and implement automatic synthesis of PGs into digital circuits. For
the latter, much of the code developed for the precursor formalism
of Conditional Partial Order Graphs (CPOGs) can be re-used. One of
the important problems that needs to be automated is that of simplification
of (T)PG expressions, in the sense of deriving an equivalent expression
with the minimum possible number of operators. Our preliminary research
suggests that this problem is strongly related to modular decomposition
of graphs~\cite{2005_McConnell_modular}.

We have formalised the definitions of algebra of parametrised graph in Agda, and developed the machine-checked proofs of several properties of that algebra.

The formula representation data structure was designed together with the custom structural equivalence relation on formula representations for convenient formula manipulations. The equivalence relation has been proved equivalent to the one defined using formula semantics, thus showing its adequacy.

The normal form representation data structure for PG formulae was designed with its semantics defined as translation to the corresponding general formula representations.

The algorithm of finding the normal form of general formulae was developed and was proved to be correct.

The immediate future work includes formalising the proof of CPOG being a model of PG Algebra and modification of algorithm to compute the canonical form (where each graph node is mentioned no more than once) instead of just a normal form. Canonical form is much more useful because its size is at most quadratic while the size of a normal form is exponential in general.

The code used in this thesis is attached as an appendix.

\section{Processor instruction set encoding}

The Chapter~\ref{chap:PGEncoding} presented the PG model based methodology for micro architecture
design and studied its application for specification and synthesis
of a central processor microcontroller. The key contribution is
the method for synthesis of optimal instruction op-codes; the corresponding
optimisation problem is formulated in terms of PGs and reduced to
the well-known Boolean satisfiability problem. The method is implemented
in a software tool and can be used within the conventional micro architecture
design flow.

The studied processor example is purely academic. Nonetheless, it captures
many important features of real processors. It has been demonstrated
that the PG model is capable of modelling concurrency between different
subsystems and handling multiple choice during instruction execution.
Future work focuses on specification and synthesis of a real processor
and optimisation of the encoding algorithms.
